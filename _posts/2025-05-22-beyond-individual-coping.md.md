### Introduction

While considerable scholarship has addressed trauma among displaced youth, relatively little empirical work has examined how **social capital shapes mental health outcomes** in refugee contexts. In this study, Im et al. (2025) explore the role of bonding and bridging social capital in shaping the mental health support landscape for Somali refugee youth in Nairobi, Kenya.

Published in the *International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health*, the study offers a **mixed-methods analysis** that captures both the statistical relationships between social capital and perceived well-being, and the lived narratives of help-seeking and resilience within a structurally marginalized population.

---

### Methods and Scope

The study draws on quantitative survey data from 189 Somali youth, complemented by 28 semi-structured interviews. Core constructs include:

- **Perceived emotional distress**
- **Coping strategies** (individual and collective)
- **Social capital indicators** (network size, trust, support)
- **Barriers to formal help-seeking**

Regression models were used to identify key predictors of emotional support, while thematic analysis captured the relational dimensions of trust and informal caregiving.

### Key Findings

- Despite high levels of reported emotional distress, only **~40%** of participants reported seeking support for their emotional challenges.
- **Bonding social capital**—particularly trust within family and close friendship networks—was the strongest predictor of perceived support, with a statistically significant effect (β = 0.343, p = 0.012).
- Community trust and scope of perceived support networks were positively associated with improved mental health perception (β = 0.417, p = 0.001).
- Youth relied more on **faith leaders and peer networks** than on formal services, citing both accessibility and cultural fit as critical reasons.

---

### Discussion

This study advances the field by demonstrating that **coping among displaced youth is neither purely individualistic nor pathology-driven**. Instead, support emerges through **socially embedded, culturally informed relational systems**—what the authors term "community-mediated resilience."

From an implementation perspective, the findings urge a pivot away from individual trauma-focused interventions toward **community-anchored mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) systems** that recognize trust, proximity, and shared cultural idioms as mechanisms of care.

The paper makes a clear methodological contribution by integrating social capital theory with refugee mental health research, and provides **actionable evidence** for practitioners designing peer-led or lay provider-based interventions.
